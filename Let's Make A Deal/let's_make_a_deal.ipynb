    "The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle named after Monty Hall, the original host of the game show \"Let's Make a Deal\". The problem goes like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You're on a game show, and there are three doors. Behind one door is a car, behind the others, goats. You choose a door, say No. 1.\n",
    "2. Now the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, \"Do you want to pick door No. 2?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it to your advantage to switch your choice of doors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Counter-intuitively, the answer is yes. If you switch doors, you have a 2/3 chance of winning the car, while if you stick to your initial choice, you have a 1/3 chance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively most people believe that each of the 2 remaining doors has an equal probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the following simulation will show that switching is the better strategy."
